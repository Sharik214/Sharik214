/*Write a function called swap() that interchanges two int values passed to it by the call- ing program. (Note that this function swaps the values of the
variables in the calling pro- gram, not those in the function.) Youâ€™ll need to decide how to pass the arguments. Create a main() program to exercise this
function.*/
